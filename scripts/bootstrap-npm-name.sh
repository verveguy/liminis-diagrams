# One-time bootstrap: reserve @liminis/diagrams on npm so that trusted
# publishing can be configured for it.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# The release workflow authenticates by npm trusted publishing (OIDC), which is
# configured from a package's own settings page on npmjs.com. That page does not
# exist until the package does, so a name that has never been published cannot
# have a trusted publisher registered. The first publish therefore cannot use
# OIDC, and has to be a manual one.
#
# This script makes that first publish a deliberately empty 0.0.0 stub rather
# than the real 0.1.0. That matters: npm provenance can only be produced by a CI
# publish from a public repository, so a hand-published 0.1.0 would permanently
# lack provenance -- and 0.1.0 is the version people actually install. Reserving
# the name with a stub keeps the real release on the workflow, with attestation
# intact.
#
# It publishes from a temporary directory, never from the repository. Running
# `npm publish` in the repo would fire `prepack` (building and shipping the real
# dist/ under a junk version number) and hit the LIMINIS_ALLOW_PUBLISH guard.
#
# Usage
# -----
#     ./scripts/bootstrap-npm-name.sh
#
# Safe to re-run: it stops if the name is already taken and tells you by whom.

1. Register the trusted publisher.

   Go to  https://www.npmjs.com/package/${PKG}/access
   Find the "Trusted Publisher" section and choose GitHub Actions, then:

       Organization or user  ${GH_OWNER}
       Repository            ${GH_REPO}
       Workflow filename     ${WORKFLOW}
       Environment           (leave blank)

   The workflow path is fixed by the spec for issue #1 (FR-010) as
   .github/workflows/${WORKFLOW}, so registering it now is safe even though the
   file does not exist yet. If that filename ever changes, this registration
   must be updated or the release will fail to authenticate.

2. Do NOT publish 0.1.0 by hand.

   Let issue #3 cut it through the release workflow, so the release carries npm
   provenance. A manual publish cannot produce provenance at all.

3. After 0.1.0 is live, retire the placeholder:

       npm deprecate '${PKG}@${STUB_VERSION}' 'Placeholder used to reserve the name; use 0.1.0 or later.'

   Do this only AFTER 0.1.0 exists. While ${STUB_VERSION} is the only version,
   deprecating it marks the entire package as deprecated.
